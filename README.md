| Simple learning                          | Quite new so the community is not that extensive                                       |
| Lightweight bundle                       | People with experience in other frameworks may have a little more difficulty learning. |

| You can install just what you need                                                | Because it is a lib, it ends up depending on other frameworks and design patterns |
